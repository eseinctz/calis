# CALIS: AI-Driven Context-Aware Encryption for SDN-Enabled Smart-Home IoT

## Overview

CALIS (Context-Aware Lightweight IoT Security) is an AI-driven context-aware encryption system designed for Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled smart-home IoT environments. CALIS dynamically adapts encryption strategies based on real-time contextual factors such as device capabilities, network traffic, and security requirements. This ensures both lightweight operation and robust security, setting it apart from traditional static encryption systems.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Adaptation & Context-Aware Security**: CALIS adapts encryption protocols based on the context of network traffic and device constraints using machine learning models.
- **Integration with SDN**: Enhances SDN-based smart-home IoT networks with context-aware encryption to improve security without adding excessive computational overhead.
- **Data Privacy and Confidentiality**: Provides secure data transmission while preserving the privacy of sensitive IoT data.
